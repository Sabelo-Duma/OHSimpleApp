Continuous exposure to noise levels equal to or above 85 dB(A), averaged over an eight-hour workday, <strong> may cause noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) which is permanent and irreversible. </strong></div> <br><div> <strong> The effects of the above noise exposure on employees include: </strong> </div> <div> <ul> <li> noise induced hearing loss, </li> <li> masking of wanted sounds such as warning signals and conversation, </li> <li> non-auditory effects such as abnormal adrenal hormone secretion, increased heart rate, disturbed sleep patterns and fatigue. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <strong> Three types of hearing loss as a result of noise-exposure are usually distinguished: </strong> </div> <div> <ul> <li> Temporary threshold shift, which entails a short-lived impairment of auditory sensitivity. </li> <li> Permanent threshold shift, where impairment of auditory sensitivity is not reversible. </li> <li> Acoustic trauma, which follows a single intense exposure to noise e.g. an explosion. </li> </ul> </div> <div> If exposure to noise, which causes a major temporary threshold shift, is maintained, the threshold of hearing will not recover completely in time, and a permanent threshold shift occurs. </div> <div width=100%> <p><img src=" & base64ImageImageback4 & " ; width=85% ;height=300 ;border=0 /></p> </div> <div> <p><strong> 5.4 Process and Task Description </strong></p> </div> <div> <p><strong style='background-color: yellow'> 1.

Individualised selection and fitment of HPD's must be conducted by a competent person, i.e. an OHP or other suitably competent person, preferably in conjunction with the Risk Based Medical Examinations (in this case Audiometric Testing). This examination incorporates an HPD compatibility assessment, the findings of which must be considered during selection and fitment, as should the selection criteria. Accordingly, and as stated previously, selection, fitment and instruction with regard to HPD's should be addressed at the time of the audiometric test.

Training </strong></p><strong> Improvement of Current Control Measures </strong><br> The employees in the following areas need training in the proper use of prescribed HPDs:<br> &bull; <strong> Insert according to evaluations in results tables </strong> <br>The employees engaged in the following occupations need training in the proper use of prescribed HPDs: <br>&bull; <strong> Insert according to evaluations in results tables </strong><br> Such training must include information on workplace noise levels, the correct fitment of HPDs (see fitment and illustration under Section 8.3), HPD attenuation ratings (noise reduction ratings), correct storage of HPDs, HPD maintenance and replacement as well as the aspects detailed in Section 8.3 of this report.<br> After consultation with the health and safety committee and the health and safety representative, designated for that workplace, a Training Program must be established for all employees who may be exposed to noise at or above the Noise Rating Limit that incorporates the following: <ul> <li> the content and scope of the NIHL Regulations.</li> <li> the potential sources of exposure to noise in the specific work environment. </li> <li> the potential risks to health and safety caused by exposure to noise. </li> <li> the measures taken by the employer to protect an employee against the detrimental effects of exposure to noise. </li> <li> the precautions to be taken by the employees to protect themselves against the health risks associated with the exposure, including the wearing and use of earplugs and earmuffs. </li> <li> the necessity, correct use, maintenance and limitations of hearing protectors, facilities and engineering control measures provided. </li> <li> the assessment of exposure, the purpose of noise monitoring, the necessity for medical surveillance and the long-term benefits and limitations of undergoing such surveillance. </li> <li> the Noise Rating Limit for hearing conservation and its meaning. </li> <li> the procedures for reporting, correcting, and replacing defective personal hearing protectors and for engineering noise control measures. </li> </ul> Records of training given to an employee, as detailed above, must be kept for as long as the employee remains employed at the workplace in which he/she is being exposed to noise. Such training must also be conducted prior to the placement of the relevant employee. Refresher training must be conducted annually or at intervals that may be recommended by the health and safety committee and the health and safety representative. The above-mentioned training must be provided by a person who is competent to do so and who has adequate personal practical experience and theoretical knowledge of all aspects of the work carried out by the employee. All visitors or persons other than employees who may be affected by noise exposure at the workplace must also be given adequate information, instruction and training and must be provided with at least disposable hearing protectors. <p><strong> 8.6. Records </strong></p> <p>Records of assessments, noise monitoring (i.e. this Report) and all medical surveillance records, including the baseline audiogram of every employee, must be kept for a minimum period of 40 years. If the employer ceases activities, his personal records must be handed over or forwarded by registered post, to the relevant provincial director, provided that those records shall contain at least the following information:</p> <ul> <li> Each employee's surname, forenames, gender, date of birth, name of spouse or closest relative and, where available, permanent address and postal code. </li> <li> a record of the types of work carried out that caused noise exposure and, where relevant, their location, with starting and finishing dates and with average duration of exposure in hours per week. </li> <li> a record of any previous work-related noise exposure prior to an employee's current employment. </li> <li> the dates of medical surveillance and results of all audiograms. </li> </ul> <br>Records of training given to an employee, as detailed above, must be kept for as long as the employee remains employed at the workplace in which he/she is being exposed to noise. <p><strong> 8.7. Workplace monitoring </strong></p> Noise exposure assessments and/or measurements must be repeated by an Approved Inspection Authority (AIA) at intervals not <strong> exceeding two years </strong> or as soon as any changes occur that could result in a change in or redistribution of noise levels, or if there is any suspicion that the current/previous assessment is no longer valid (upon acquisition of new machinery/equipment, relocation of potentially noisy equipment, etc.) Furthermore, the <strong> Department of Employment and Labour </strong> requires other Occupational Hygiene Inspections to be conducted for the facility to be fully legally compliant (in terms of current and pending legislative requirements). These include (<strong>but are not limited to</strong>): <strong> Choose applicable or add other surveys deemed necessary. </strong> <ul> <li> Hazardous Chemical Agents Exposure Survey (HCA Regulations, 2021)</li> <li> sbestos Inventory and Risk Assessment (Asbestos Abatement Regulations, 2020)</li> <li> Artificial Illumination Survey (Environmental Regulations for Workplaces, 2003) </li> <li> Indoor Air Quality Survey (Environmental Regulations for Workplaces, 2003) </li> <li> <p>Hazardous Biological Agents Surveys (HBA Regulations, 2022) </li> <li> Ergonomics Assessments (Ergonomics Regulations, 2019)</li> <li> Vibration Surveys (Occupational Health and Safety Act, 85 of 1993, and others) </li> </ul> You are welcome to contact Gijima OHES (an Approved Inspection Authority) for professional assistance with the above. <div style=margin-bottom:80px><table style=page-break-before:always; width=100% cellspacing=0 cellpadding=7> <tbody> <tr> <td bgcolor=#1a3b68 width=7% style=background:#1a3b68;color:#ffffff;font-size:20pt;font-family:Calibri;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;padding:0in; ><strong> 9.0 </strong> </td> <td bgcolor=#1a3b68 width=93% style=background:#1a3b68;color:#ffffff;font-size:20pt;font-family:Calibri;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;padding:0in;><strong> Conclusion </strong> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p>Based on the outcomes of the noise survey performed at <strong> (insert client name and site name here- </strong> <strong> same as in </strong> <strong> Main findings Section of this report </strong><strong>)</strong> in <strong> (month-year of survey - </strong> <strong> same as in </strong> <strong> Main findings Section of this report </strong><strong>)</strong>, the following was concluded:</p> Several areas were identified or confirmed as noise zones and specific individual employees being identified or confirmed as being excessively exposed to noise:<br> <strong> Areas Identified or Confirmed as Noise Zoning: </strong> <strong> Information same as in Main findings Section of this report) </strong> <ul> <li> <em> X Number </em> of Areas were identified as &ldquo;new&rdquo; Noise Zones </li> <li> <em> Y Number of Areas </em> were confirmed as previously Identified Noise Zones </li> <li> <em> Z Number of Areas </em> previously identified as Noise Zones no longer are considered to be Noise Zones. </li> </ul> <strong> Individuals subjected to Noise Dosimetry found to be or confirmed to be excessively exposed to noise: </strong> <strong> Information same as in Main findings Section of this report) </strong> <ul> <li> <em> X Number </em> of Occupations were identified as &ldquo;new&rdquo; occupations that are excessively exposed </li> <li> <em> Y Number of Occupations </em> were identified as previously identified occupations that are excessively exposed </li> <li> <em> Z Number of Areas </em> previously identified as excessively exposed occupations are no longer excessively exposed. </li> </ul> <strong> Another Objective of the survey was to determine the efficacy of hearing conservation measures applied.
